Implement the Stars Block used in a card and catalog.

Hold Alt key (Option on MacOS) to measure distances in Figma.

Here are the Layout Tasks Instructions

Requirements:
Reset browser's default margin
Add 6 stars blocks with 5 stars__star elements each.
Add stars--0, stars--1, stars--2 ... stars--5 modifiers to the blocks one per each
Don't add any other classes to the elements.
The block with stars--N modifier should have exactly N first stars active.
use background-image for stars (see images folder). Don't use <img> or <svg> tags.
The star size and the distance should be taken from Figma
Use display: flex for the stars block to avoid an issue with extra spaces between individual stars
Don't add vertical margins between blocks.
DON'T use gap property for flex container because it does not work in tests
