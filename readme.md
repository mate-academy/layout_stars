## The task
Implement the `stars` block used in [the card](https://www.figma.com/file/bS8N1lTT0Ew0Brf1Nfl36iMV/Product-Cards?node-id=0%3A1).
Do not need to implement card in this task, just stars.

- Reset browser's default `margin`
- Implement 6 `stars` blocks
  - The first one is general
  - Add 5 more blocks with a modifier per block from `stars--1` to `stars--5`
  - Each block should have a given number of active stars without adding any special class for an individual star. (Use `nth-child`)
- The star size is fixed
- The distance between the stars is also fixed
