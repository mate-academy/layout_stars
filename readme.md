## The task
Implement the [`stars` block](https://www.figma.com/file/EIBkG1dy1jnK88YPO34Qir/Moyo-Catalog-updated) used in card and catalog.
You DON'T need to implement the card now, just the stars block.

![Stars](./reference/stars.png)
___
- You can find star images in `images` folder
- Reset browser's default `margin`
- Implement 6 blocks with `stars` class
  - The first should have `stars--0` class
  - The next 5 blocks should have an extra class `stars--1`, `stars--2` ... `stars--5` (one extra class per block)
- Each block should have exactly 5 stars styled as in the card design
- The number of active (yellow) stars should be different for all 6 blocks depending on modifier class
  - The first block (with just `stars` class) don't have active stars
  - The other 5 blocks have exactly N fisrt stars active where N is a numbers in an additional css class (modifier) `stars--N`
  - Add stars as background-images, not as "img" or "svg" tags
- Each star in a block should have a class `stars__star` and no extra classes or inline styles
  - The star size is fixed (see in the design)
  - The distance between the stars is also fixed
  - Use `display: flex` for the `stars` block to avoid an issue with extra spaces between individual stars

## Tips & Hints
- Check the design again. See the difference in size between star image and its
container?
- There's no need to add vertical margins between rows of stars.
- !!! DON'T use `gap` property because it does not work in tests
