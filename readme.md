## The task
Implement the [`stars` block](https://www.figma.com/file/EIBkG1dy1jnK88YPO34Qir/Moyo-Catalog-updated) used in a card and catalog.
You DON'T need to implement the card now, just the stars block.

![Stars](./reference/stars.png)
___
- You can find star images in the `images` folder
- Reset browser's default `margin`
- Implement 6 blocks with `stars` class. Each block should have 5 elements inside with the class `stars__star`.
  - Stars should be added as centered background-images, not as "img" or "svg" tags
  - The star size and the distance should be taken from Figma
  - Use `display: flex` for the `stars` block to avoid an issue with extra spaces between individual stars
- Add one of the next extra classes (a `modifier`) `stars--0`, `stars--1`, `stars--2` ... `stars--5` to each block
- The block with `stars--N` modifier should have exactly `N` first stars active

## Tips & Hints
- Check the design again. See the difference in size between star image and its
container?
- There's no need to add vertical margins between rows of stars.
- !!! DON'T use `gap` property for `flex` container because it does not work in tests
