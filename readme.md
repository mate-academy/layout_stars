## The task
Implement the [`stars` block](https://www.figma.com/file/EIBkG1dy1jnK88YPO34Qir/Moyo-Catalog-updated) used in card and catalog.
You DON'T need to implement the card now, just the stars block.

## Tips & Hints
- Check the design again. See the difference in size between star image and its
container?
- There's no need to add vertical margins between rows of stars.
- !!! DON'T use `gap` property because it does not work in tests
